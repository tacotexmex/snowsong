Sn0wSong 2.0.1
Sn0wZ0ne 2.0.1

For all versions of Minecraft.

Better Sound for Minecraft...MUCH better!

Welcome to the end result of years of painstaking sound engineering and hundreds of hours of game play testing.  Welcome to the long awaited and greatly anticipated release of my Total Sound Conversion Resource Pack for all versions of Minecraft.

This version provides replacement of every sound effect and every song all the way up to Minecraft version 1.X!  Shulker sounds have been added, new cave ambient sounds, two brand new songs for the Menu screen, countless improvements on the original Sn0wSong sounds and songs from previous versions of the resource pack.

This is 100% original!  Every Sound Effect has been carefully created, edited, normalized, equalized, quantized and digitally mastered (mistressed) by Sn0wShepherd (aka:  Alecia M. Shepherd, PhD).  Every piece of Music is an original composition, performance, arrangement and engineering masterpiece of sound.

The original versions of Sn0wSong totalled over 1.4 MILLION tracked downloads!

I am absolutely humbled, and stunned, and I really can't even begin to imagine just exactly what such a number means.  I hope that it means 1 million plus people have downloaded, installed and thoroughly enjoyed my complete sound resource pack.  I really really hope it also means that at least tens, if not dozens of people have been inspired by the sounds, by the music and the overall uniform effect that I have struggled very hard to maintain.  A crazy 88 folders containing about 870 sound files, including the ambient tracks and full songs comprise Sn0wSong!

Thank you all SO much for your support!  I truly love each and every one of you!  I am humbled, as I said earlier, and just shake my head and smile when I see the numbers of downloads blow up all over the internet.  Thank you!!  I now pray that 2.0 will get just as many if not more downloads!

I always say, "If you like it, if you love it, share it!  If you hate it, share it anyway and your friends can also have a good laugh!"

Still, I have never taken or earned by ads or clicks or anything at all even one red American penny from any of this.

Only very recently did I start a Patreon site at the request of my friends.  It is an opportunity for you to invest in Sn0wShepherd...me...Alecia!  If you love what I am doing and want to be a part of it, you can get on board at the Patreon site!  Patrons who give $50 or more get access to a secret archive of original music, by me, that no one else gets to have copies of.  Each song celebrates each of the Patrons that support me at that level or greater!

In appreciation of 1.2 million downloads of all the previous versions of Sn0wSong, I have included 2 brand new songs, one of which will be appearing as the title track on my 9th album, Syrup 128; hopefully releasing for FREE, just like all of my stuff, through my Patreon and my personal website by next year.

INSTALLATION

Place the containing .ZIP file into your resourcepacks folder under %appdata%/roaming/.minecraft and start Minecraft from your choice of launcher.  When the game has finished loading, click the Options button and then click Resource Packs.  Continue clicking little arrows and sliders and such until you find this file's Zip-Skin file and click its pretty little icon with the neat white Snow Leopard outline on it.

That's all there is to it.  It will take a while for this large file to parse into the Minecraft cache for repainting your worlds in amazing new sounds and songs that truly change how you feel and react to one of the greatest games ever made.

Now, play and enjoy a brand new game experience in Minecraft you have to hear to believe.


GUI TEXTURE CHANGES

Minecraft v1.7.10 and under will not need any changes to GUI in Sn0wZ0ne/Sn0wSong
Minecraft v1.8.x added Lapis to the Enchanting Table
Minecraft v1.9.x added Blaze Powder to the Brewing Stand
Minecraft v1.10.x added Shields boxes to Inventories

All of these GUI changes are suffixed in the texture folders with 1_10_2.

Replace existing texture files by deleting the original texture file and then by renaming these update files by removing the 1_10_2 suffix for all of the files that need to be changed for the version of Minecraft you are playing.
